# Case Study 1- Soil Moisture Meter
## Description

*	This Soil Moisture Meter is used for indicating the moisture content of a given soil sample.
*	In Agriculture, crop production will be easier when the farmer monitors the requirement of water at different stages and in different amounts. 
*	Time to time measurement of soil moisture is important.
*	It is an electronic device that measures soil moisture content accurately and precisely.

The digital soil moisture meter circuit is for monitoring the soil moisture content in irrigation farms, is an electronic device that measures soil moisture content accurately and precisely.

## Components Details
1.	Finger Print Module : 
Optical Fingerprint reader Sensor Finger Print Sensor (R305) -TTL UART is a finger print sensor module with TTL UART interface. The user can store the finger print data in the module and can configure it in 1:1 or 1: N mode for identifying the person. The finger print module can directly interface with 3v3 or 5v Microcontroller.
2.	Atmega32 :
 The AVR micro-Controller is based on the advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture. ATmega32 micro-Controller is a low power CMOS technology based controller. Due to RISC architecture AVR microcontroller can execute 1 million of instructions per second if cycle frequency is 1 MHz provided by crystal oscillator.
3.	16x2 LCD Display :
4. RTC modules are simply TIME and DATE remembering systems which have battery setup which in the absence of external power keeps the module running. This keeps the TIME and DATE up to date. So we can have accurate TIME and DATE from RTC module whenever we want.
5.	LM7805:
The LM7805 monolithic 3-terminal positive voltage regulators employ internal current-limiting, thermal shutdown and safe-area compensation, making them essentially indestructible. If adequate heat sinking is provided, they can deliver over 1.0A output current. 
6.	Push Button, Resisters, buzzer etc.
