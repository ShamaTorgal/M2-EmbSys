# Module-2 project
# Soil Moisture Meter 
    
##  Description
* Soil Moisture Sensors also enable us to develop smart agricultural systems that respond to environmental conditions automatically.
*	This Soil Moisture Meter is used for indicating the moisture content of a given soil sample.
*	In Agriculture, crop production will be easier when the farmer monitors the requirement of water at different stages and in different amounts. 
*	Time to time measurement of soil moisture is important.
*	It is an electronic device that measures soil moisture content accurately and precisely.
* The Block diagram Contains a Controller, Potentiometer (instead of Soil moisture sensor), Temperature sensor, motor and LCD Display.
* In Soil moisture sensor a electrical current is sent from one probe to the other, which allows the sensor to measure the resistance of the soil between them. Here Potentiometer is used as a Soil moisture sensor. 
* When the water content in the soil is high, it has a higher electrical conductivity (water is a good conductor of electricity). Hence, a lower resistance reading is obtained which indicates high soil moisture. 
* When the water content in the soil is low, it has poorer electrical conductivity. Hence, a higher resistance reading is obtained, which indicates low soil moisture.
  
##  Applications
* Used in Agriculture.
* Landscape irrigation.
* Household Gardening.
* Research and Forecasting.
* Irrigation for Sporting Fields.
