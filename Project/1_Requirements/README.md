# Biometric Attendance System based on Finger Print
## Description

*	This Biometric Attendance system based on finger print is to replace the manual procedure of taking attendance. 
* It saves more time when compared to the manual attendance system.
*	This system will be more reliable and efficient.
*	In this project, fingerprint Module and AVR(atmega32) to record attendance. 
*	By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. 

## Requirements

* High Level Requirements 

|ID|	Description|
| --- | --- |
| HR01|It should be able to take input from the user|
|HR02	|It should efficiently detect any finger print|
|  HR03	|It should be able to do functions like Enroll, Detect, Increment and Decrement finger-print data.|
 | HR04|	It should display information whenever a finger print is detected, and buzzer should beep once.|

* Low Level Requirements

|ID	|             Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|LR01	| If the user wants to Enroll press key “1”|
|LR02	| If the user wants to reset or delete data from EEPROM press key “2” |
 | LR03| 	If the user wants to decrement or increment the data press key “3” and “4”|
|LR04|	User may download the attendance data by pressing and holding key 4. |
