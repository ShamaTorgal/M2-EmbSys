## 1. Description
* Soil Moisture Sensors also enable us to develop smart agricultural systems that respond to environmental conditions automatically.
*	This Soil Moisture Meter is used for indicating the moisture content of a given soil sample.
*	In Agriculture, crop production will be easier when the farmer monitors the requirement of water at different stages and in different amounts. 
*	Time to time measurement of soil moisture is important.
*	It is an electronic device that measures soil moisture content accurately and precisely.




## 2. Requirements

* 2.1 High Level Requirements 

|ID|	Description|
| --- | --- |
|HR01	|It shall measure soil moisture content accurately and precisely|
|HR02	|It Shall be able to sense the Atmospheric and Soil Temperature|
|HR03	|It Shall Display information regarding temp, soil moisture in LCD|
|HR04	|It Shall be able to take input from user when the manual water supply is needed|
|HR05   | It shall start supplying water whenever less moisture is detected| 
	
* 2.2 Low Level Requirements

|ID |           Description |        
| --- | --- | 
|LH01	| Whenever Soil moisture probes are put into soil -  Display moisture level |
|LH02	| Temperature sensor is ON - Display Atmospheric and soil temp.  |
|LH03 |If High resistance in potentiometer is detedted ( water content in the soil is less) -  Display Low Moisture ( Dry ) |
|LH04| If low moisture is detected - Motor ON condition |
|LH05 |If low resistance in potentiometer is detedted  ( water content in the soil is more) - Display high Moisture ( wet )  |
