
# Implementation

This folder conatins all the coding files for proper execution of program.

## Instructions to execute
* Clone my repository.
* Go to 3_Implementation folder.
* Download the .ino, simulation, .elf and .hex files.
* Make sure your system meets all software requirements.
* Open .ino file with Arduino IDE. Turn on compatibility and verify the code.
* After this we will get a path where we can get .hex and .elf files.
* Open simulation file with SimulIDE.
* Right click on the circuit and select load firmware. 
* To load the firmware select .hex file which was generated.
* Save the circuit and run.
